Hi everyone and welcome to my blog. My name is Farhad and I am a PhD studnet at PolyMtl.

I have been programming machine learning and optimization algorithms for years and recently switch to Julia. 

I thought I share with you some of the tutorials I found useful and add some of my own comments and steps to them. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me with feedback or just normal conversation. 

Best,
Farhad
